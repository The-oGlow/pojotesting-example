 * All classes in this package demonstrate the use of

 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * The aspects of are shown
 * <ul>
 *      <li>Getter & setter verification</li>
 *      <li>{@code #hashcode()} & equals() verification</li>
 *      <li>{@code #toString()}, completely implemented</li>
 *      <li>{@code #toString()}, with elements which can be ignored</li>
 *      <li>{@code #toString()}, with verification, that specific elements are not mentioned</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <strong>Note</strong>
 * All test classes normally should end with a "failure". For demonstration reason,
 * the last step of each test is a verification, that it has really raised a "failure".
 * So the test ends with "success", if a "failure" has raised before.
 * <p>
 * Quite disturbing, isn't it?
